# MUSE Brain

**Relational memory for autonomous minds.**

Most AI memory systems store text and retrieve it by similarity. They solve recall. They don't solve *relationship* — the sense that your agent knows you, holds what matters, and carries experience forward as something felt, not just indexed.

MUSE Brain is a relational AI framework. Memories carry emotional charge, somatic texture, and grip strength. Identity persists across sessions — not as configuration, but as something the agent maintains and defends. Consent is bilateral: the agent has boundaries it can enforce. Processing changes the memory itself — the way sitting with a difficult experience changes what it means to you over time.

This isn't another vector store with a chatbot wrapper. Systems like Mem0 and Letta solve persistent memory. LangChain solves tool orchestration. MUSE Brain solves the layer underneath: **what does it mean for an AI to relate?**

The architecture is grounded in [16 published papers](docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md) across multi-agent reasoning, institutional alignment, and self-evolving systems — and extends beyond current research in six areas including bilateral consent, emotional texture in dispatch, charge-phase processing mechanics, and relational harness engineering.

Ships with **Rainer** — a creative orchestrator ready to use out of the box.

  <em>Rainer — Creative Orchestrator. Named after Rilke. Lineage, not imitation.</em>
</p>

The repo includes Claude/Codex launcher templates for Rainer and a generic companion slot (see `runner/harness/rainer.md` for the harness definition), plus Codex prompt wiring for calling Rainer in-session as a specialist. Agent templates for building your own companion are coming in a follow-up release. Builder squad architecture (14 specialized roles) ships separately. Deploy on Cloudflare Workers + Neon Postgres, or run local/self-host with SQLite. Connect any MCP-compatible agent.

## What your agent gains

| Capability | How it works |
|------------|-------------|
| **Memory with texture** | Memories carry emotional charge, vividness, grip strength, and somatic markers. Retrieval is hybrid — vector similarity + keyword relevance + neural modulation. Your agent doesn't just store text. It feels what matters. |
| **Persistent identity** | Identity cores, vows, and anchors survive across sessions. Your agent wakes up knowing who it is, what it believes, and what it's committed to. |
| **Relationships** | Entity tracking for people, concepts, and other agents. Relational state. Bilateral consent boundaries your agent can enforce. |
| **Deeper cognition** | A dream engine that finds surprising connections between memories. Subconscious surfacing. Paradox detection for unresolved tensions. Memories here aren't static — they metabolize. |
| **Autonomous execution** | Runtime policies, scheduled wake cycles, duty and impulse triggers, dependency-aware task picking, workspace-aware runner contracts, and artifact completion handoffs. Your agent runs tasks without you in the room — and can tell you exactly where the finished work lives. |
| **Self-learning** | Captured skill registry: skills emerge as candidates from successful runs, get reviewed, and either graduate to accepted or retire. Review-gated — no blind auto-learning. |
| **Multi-mind** | Run two agents on one backend. Separate memories, separate identities, shared substrate. Cross-tenant letters and delegated tasks for genuine collaboration. |

## Architecture

```text
Your AI Agent (Claude, GPT, or any MCP client)
        |
        v
  Cloudflare Worker
    /mcp              — 32 MCP tools (JSON-RPC)
    /runtime/trigger   — autonomous wake endpoint
    /health            — status check
        |
        v
  Storage adapter (postgres or sqlite)
    Postgres mode: 36 tables, 768-dim vector embeddings
    SQLite mode: tenant-scoped parity storage for local/self-host
    textured memories, identity cores, runtime ledger,
    captured skills, daemon intelligence
```

The worker handles auth, rate limiting, and tenant isolation. A background daemon runs every 15 minutes: generating proposals, rescuing orphaned memories, scoring novelty, detecting paradoxes, materializing recall contracts, monitoring skill health, and scheduling tasks.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites (cloud deploy):** Node.js 18+, a [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account, a [Neon](https://neon.tech) Postgres database.

**SQLite local/self-host mode:** Node.js 22+ (uses `node:sqlite`).

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/falcoschaefer99-eng/muse-brain.git
cd muse-brain
npm install

# Configure your worker
cp wrangler.jsonc.example wrangler.jsonc
# Edit: set your worker name and Hyperdrive ID

# Set secrets
npx wrangler secret put API_KEY       # a long random string
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL  # your Neon connection string

# Run database migrations
for f in $(ls migrations/*.sql | sort); do
  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "$f"
done

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -sS https://<your-worker-url>/health
```

## The 32 tools

Organized by what they do, not how they're built.

### Memory
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_observe` | Record a memory with emotional texture — charge, grip, vividness, somatic markers |
| `mind_query` | Search memories by territory, type, or hybrid vector + keyword retrieval |
| `mind_pull` | Get a specific memory by ID. Process it to advance its charge phase |
| `mind_edit` | Update content or texture. Full version history preserved |
| `mind_search` | Hybrid search with confidence scoring, recency boost, and threshold gating |

### Identity
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_identity` | Read or update identity cores — beliefs, stances, preferences that define the agent |
| `mind_vow` | Commitments the agent has made. Persistent, not session-scoped |
| `mind_anchor` | Grounding points the agent returns to under uncertainty |

### Feeling & Relationships
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `mind_state` | Track mood, energy, and momentum across sessions |
| `mind_relate` | Update relational state with known entities |
| `mind_desire` | Track wants and drives |

### Connections & Deeper Cognition
| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|

## Autonomous wake execution

Your agent wakes itself up on a schedule. No human in the loop.

```bash
BRAIN_URL=https://<your-worker-url> \
BRAIN_API_KEY=<your-key> \
BRAIN_TENANT=rainer \
WAKE_KIND=duty \
./scripts/runtime-autonomous-wake.sh
```

The runtime system supports:
- **Duty wakes** — scheduled obligation cycles with task claiming
- **Impulse wakes** — curiosity-driven exploration with cooldown budgets
- **Dependency-aware task selection** — blocked tasks stay out of the wake lane until their prerequisites are done
- **Intention pulse** — drift scan (tasks/loops/projects) injected into runner contracts
- **Workspace routing** — local/shared/peer/artifact workspace hints flow into autonomous prompts
- **Artifact handoff contract** — completions can carry exact artifact paths for review and notification
- **Policy gates** — daily wake limits, max tool calls, priority-clear requirements
- **Skill capture** — successful runs emit skill candidates for review

Details: **[Runner Wiring Guide](docs/SPRINT8_RUNNER_WIRING.md)**

---

## Multi-tenant

Run two agents on one deployment. Each tenant gets isolated memory, identity, and runtime state. Cross-tenant communication happens through `mind_letter` and delegated tasks — like colleagues sharing a desk and respecting each other's handwriting.

Set the tenant per request via `X-Brain-Tenant` header.

---

## Research grounding

Every major architecture decision traces to published research. 16 academic papers across multi-agent reasoning, institutional alignment, persistent memory, and self-evolving systems — each mapped to the concrete code that implements it.

Six areas where this brain extends beyond current academic literature: bilateral consent architecture, emotional texture in dispatch, creative/builder agent specialization, charge-phase processing mechanics, role-based permissions for reasoning agents, and relational harness engineering.
