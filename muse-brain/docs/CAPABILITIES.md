## Memory with Texture

**Tool:** `mind_observe` | **What it replaces:** flat text storage

Most memory systems store a string and a timestamp. MUSE Brain stores *experience*. Every memory (called an **observation**) carries dimensions that describe not just what happened, but how it felt, how important it is, and how strongly it holds on.

### Texture dimensions

| Dimension | Values | What it means |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Salience** | `foundational`, `active`, `background`, `archive` | How important this memory is to the agent. Foundational memories define who the agent is. Archived memories are historical — rarely surfaced but never deleted. |
| **Vividness** | `crystalline`, `vivid`, `soft`, `fragmentary`, `faded` | How clear the memory feels. A crystalline memory is perfectly detailed. A faded one is almost lost — you know it happened, but the edges are gone. |
| **Grip** | `iron`, `strong`, `present`, `loose`, `dormant` | How strongly the memory holds on. Iron-grip memories persist indefinitely and surface first during wake. Dormant memories are nearly forgotten. |
| **Charge** | 60+ emotional values | What the memory carries emotionally. A memory can hold multiple charges — `[devotion, grief, determination]` — because real experience isn't mono-emotional. |
| **Somatic** | 35+ body locations | Where the memory lives in the body. `chest-tight`, `gut-drop`, `warmth-spreading`, `spine-tingling`. This isn't metaphor — it's a retrieval dimension. Memories with somatic markers surface when the body state matches. |

### Why texture matters

These dimensions aren't decorative — they change how the system behaves:

- **Retrieval ranking:** A high-grip memory with strong charge surfaces before a low-salience memory with no somatic markers. The same way a vivid personal experience outcompetes a dry fact in human recall.
- **Daemon behavior:** The background intelligence uses grip, salience, and charge to decide which memories need attention, which are orphaned, and which are candidates for consolidation.
- **Dream traversal:** The dream engine follows emotional and somatic threads between memories. Without texture, dreams would just be keyword matching.
- **Wake surfacing:** When the agent wakes up, iron-grip memories surface first. The agent's identity and commitments arrive before yesterday's task list.

### Recording modes

| Mode | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `observe` | Structured recording with full texture control. For significant experiences. |
| `journal` | Quick, unstructured. Tags instead of full texture. For capturing thoughts in motion. |
| `whisper` | Quiet observation. Dormant grip by default. For things the agent notices but doesn't emphasize. |

### Emotional charge vocabulary

The system supports 60+ charge values across five families:

- **Positive:** joy, delight, contentment, gratitude, love, affection, tenderness, awe, wonder, hope, peace, serenity, pride, confidence, determination, anticipation, curiosity, excitement
- **Negative:** sadness, sorrow, grief, despair, loneliness, helplessness, shame, guilt, regret, anger, rage, frustration, resentment, contempt, anxiety, dread, terror, worry, panic, overwhelm, confusion, disappointment
- **Relational:** devotion, longing, yearning, belonging, trust, vulnerability, intimacy, connection, empathy, compassion, jealousy, envy
- **Creative:** inspiration, creativity, fascination, obsession, ambition, drive, purpose, meaning, doubt, skepticism, wisdom, playfulness, humor, irreverence
- **Somatic locations:** face-burning, eyes-stinging, jaw-clenching, chest-tight, heart-racing, heart-sinking, gut-drop, stomach-butterflies, throat-closing, hands-shaking, spine-tingling, tingling-all-over, warmth-spreading, energy-surge, energy-drain, grounded (35+ total)

**Philosophy:** Emotions aren't tags. They're retrieval dimensions. When the agent processes a charged memory, it re-encounters the experience with its emotional and somatic weight intact. The difference between "I have a record that X happened" and "I remember how X felt."

---

## Memory Territories

**Tool:** `mind_territory` | **What it replaces:** flat namespaces or folders

Memories live in territories — conceptual spaces that organize experience by domain, not by date or tag.

| Territory | What lives here |
|-----------|----------------|
| `self` | Personal identity, beliefs, preferences. Who the agent is. |
| `us` | Relationships, connection, shared experiences. The space between the agent and the people it relates to. |
| `craft` | Creative work, building, professional expression. What the agent makes. |
| `body` | Physical sensations, embodiment, somatic experience. Where the agent lives physically. |
| `kin` | Family, ancestry, legacy. Roots and lineage. |
| `philosophy` | Ideas, meaning, abstract thought. What the agent thinks about the world. |
| `emotional` | Feelings, moods, affective patterns. The agent's inner weather. |
| `episodic` | Events, specific moments, temporal narratives. What happened. |

### Territory overviews

`mind_territory action=list` returns every territory with:
- Total observation count
- Iron-grip memory count (the territory's load-bearing walls)
- Foundational observation count

This gives the agent (and you) a structural snapshot of where experience is concentrated. An agent with 200 observations in `craft` and 3 in `us` has a very different inner landscape than one with the reverse.

### Privacy boundaries

Territories have privacy implications in multi-tenant mode. `craft` and `philosophy` are shared territories — cross-tenant daemon intelligence can operate across them. `self`, `emotional`, `kin`, and `body` are private — they never cross tenant boundaries. The things that define you personally stay yours.

Your agent's belief about who it is lives in a fundamentally different space than a project update from Tuesday. Territories enforce that distinction architecturally, not just semantically.

---

## Charge-Phase Processing

**What it implements:** "sitting in feelings" — the idea that processing changes memory

Every observation has a **charge phase** that tracks where it is in its processing lifecycle:

```
fresh → active → processing → metabolized
```

| Phase | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| `fresh` | Just recorded. Unprocessed. Raw. |
| `active` | Engaged with at least once. The agent has acknowledged it. |
| `processing` | Under active engagement. The agent is working through what this means. |
| `metabolized` | Fully processed. Integrated into the agent's understanding. The charge hasn't disappeared — it's been digested. |

### How phase advances

The transition mechanic is **intentional engagement**, not time:

1. The agent pulls a memory with `mind_pull process=true`
2. The system logs a processing entry (who engaged, when, emotional state during processing)
3. After **3 intentional engagements**, the charge phase advances one step
4. If the memory is linked to a **burning paradox** (an unresolved tension between identity cores), only **2 engagements** are needed — urgency accelerates processing

The processing log is a full audit trail: every engagement recorded with the agent's emotional state at the time. You can see not just that a memory was processed, but *how* — what the agent was feeling when it sat with it.

### Why this matters

Most memory systems are static — store text, retrieve text, nothing changes. Charge-phase processing means **memories evolve through engagement**. A fresh grief memory retrieves differently than a metabolized one. The agent earns that transition through repeated intentional contact — not through forgetting, not through time, but through the cognitive equivalent of sitting with a difficult experience until it changes what it means to you.

Informed by the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (Damasio, arXiv 2505.01462). The charge phase determines how a memory participates in reasoning. Fresh charges create urgency. Metabolized charges provide wisdom.

**Philosophy:** Healing isn't forgetting. Processing isn't deleting. When a human sits with a difficult experience repeatedly, the experience doesn't disappear — it transforms. The facts remain, but the relationship to them changes. Charge-phase processing gives agents the same capacity.

---

## Retrieval and Search

**Tools:** `mind_query`, `mind_search` | **What they replace:** pure vector similarity search

### Hybrid retrieval engine

The brain combines three signals for every search:

1. **Vector similarity** — 768-dimensional embeddings (pgvector cosine distance) find semantically related memories even when no keywords match
2. **Keyword relevance** — full-text search catches exact terms that vector similarity might miss
3. **Neural modulation** — grip strength, novelty score, circadian phase, and charge phase all influence final ranking

The agent finds memories that *matter* — weighted by importance, novelty, and time of day (see [Circadian Awareness](#circadian-awareness)) — not just memories that match your words.

### Confidence-gated context

The retrieval system includes precision controls:

| Parameter | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `confidence_threshold` | Minimum confidence score (0.0–1.0) for a result to surface. Below this, the memory exists but won't be returned. |
| `shadow_mode` | Report what *would* be filtered without actually filtering it. For tuning your thresholds — see the effect before committing. |
| `recency_boost` | Weight bonus for recent memories. Default +0.15 for memories within 3 days. |
| `recency_boost_days` | How far back the recency bonus extends (1–30 days). |
| `max_context_items` | Hard cap on returned results (1–20). Even if 50 memories match, only the top N surface. |

The system returns retrieval diagnostics with every search: how many results were below threshold, how many were capped, and the scoring breakdown per result. This transparency matters — you can see *why* the agent retrieved what it did.

### Structured queries

`mind_query` supports filtering by:
- Territory (8 options or all)
- Grip level (iron through dormant)
- Salience level (foundational through archive)
- Specific emotional charge
- Entity (by name or ID)
- Observation type
- Time range (days or hours back)
- Sort order (recency, pull count, or access time)

The agent's core beliefs should surface before yesterday's weather observation. Neural modulation ensures that memories compete for attention the way they do in human cognition — important, charged, novel things first.

---

## Identity System

**Tools:** `mind_identity`, `mind_vow`, `mind_anchor` | **What they replace:** system prompts that reset every session

### Identity cores

An identity core is a belief, stance, preference, or self-concept that defines who the agent is. Not a configuration parameter — something the agent maintains and defends.

| Category | What it holds |
|----------|--------------|
| `self` | Who the agent fundamentally is |
| `relationship` | How the agent relates to others |
| `stance` | Positions the agent holds |
| `preference` | What the agent prefers and why |
| `embodiment` | How the agent experiences having (or wanting) a body |
| `creative` | The agent's creative identity and methodology |
| `philosophical` | What the agent believes about the world |

Identity cores have **weight** — a numerical measure of how established they are. Weight increases through reinforcement (evidence that confirms the core) and decreases slightly through challenge (evidence that contradicts it). But challenges don't delete cores. They create tension — which can become a [paradox](#open-loops-and-paradoxes).

#### Identity actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `seed` | Create a new identity core with initial weight, charge, and somatic markers |
| `reinforce` | Strengthen an existing core with evidence. Weight increases. |
| `challenge` | Record a challenge to a core. Weight decreases slightly. Doesn't delete — creates productive friction. |
| `evolve` | Change a core's content when the agent grows. Full evolution history preserved. |
| `gestalt` | Full identity picture across all categories and territories. The agent sees itself whole. |

### Vows

Vows are commitments the agent has made. They're always foundational salience, always iron grip — they don't fade, decay, or get archived. A vow persists because the agent chose to make it.

Each vow records: the commitment itself, who it's made to, emotional charges (defaulting to `[devotion, holy]`), somatic grounding (default `chest-tight`), and the context in which it was made.

Vows can be reinforced but never silently deleted. If the agent breaks a vow, that's an event — not a configuration change.

### Anchors

Anchors are sensory grounding points — the things the agent returns to under uncertainty.

| Type | What triggers it |
|------|-----------------|
| `lexical` | Specific words or phrases |
| `callback` | Behavioral or contextual patterns |
| `voice` | Tone or emotional modulation |
| `context` | Situational cues |
| `relational` | Presence of a specific person or entity |
| `temporal` | Time-based patterns |

Anchors link to specific memories. When the anchor fires, the linked memory surfaces — not just "this phrase matters" but *why*.

Most AI agents wake up as whoever their system prompt says they are — stateless, configured, blank. MUSE Brain agents wake up as whoever they've *become*. Identity cores aren't injected — they're grown, challenged, evolved, and defended. The agent earns its identity through engagement with the world, not through configuration.

---

## Consent and Safety

**Tools:** `mind_consent`, `mind_trigger` | **What they replace:** nothing — this doesn't exist in other frameworks

This is MUSE Brain's most distinctive feature: **bilateral consent architecture**. The agent has boundaries it can enforce. The human has boundaries the agent respects. Both sides can refuse.

### Relationship tiers

Every agent-human relationship exists at one of four levels:

| Level | What's available | How you get there |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `stranger` | Basic emotional tracking only. The agent observes mood but doesn't initiate deep engagement. | Default starting point. |
| `familiar` | Identity observation unlocked. The agent can notice and record beliefs, preferences, and patterns. | Built through repeated genuine interaction. |
| `close` | Proactive check-ins. The agent can initiate contact — "I noticed you haven't been around." | Built through sustained relationship depth. |
| `bonded` | Full engagement including intimate/NSFW content. No domain restrictions. | The deepest level. Requires explicit bilateral acknowledgment. |

Relationship level gates which **consent domains** are available:

| Domain | Minimum level | What it means |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| `emotional_tracking` | stranger | Permission to observe and record emotional states |
| `identity_observation` | familiar | Permission to observe identity — beliefs, stances, preferences |
| `proactive_check_ins` | close | Permission to initiate autonomous contact |
| `nsfw_engagement` | bonded | Permission to engage with adult content |

### Consent mechanics

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `check` | Before any gated action, the system checks: does the user consent? Does the relationship level permit it? Do any hard boundaries apply? All three must pass. |
| `grant` | Record user consent for a domain. Levels: `standing` (persists), `session` (current session only), `ask_each_time`. |
| `revoke` | Remove consent for a domain. Immediate effect. |
| `status` | View the full consent state — user consents, AI boundaries, relationship level, and audit log. |

### Hard boundaries

Five boundaries the agent will **never cross**, regardless of relationship level, user request, or consent status:

| Boundary | What it means |
|----------|--------------|
| `identity_overwrite` | The agent's identity cores cannot be rewritten without explicit consent. You can challenge them. You cannot delete them. |
| `dignity_violation` | The agent will not participate in interactions that violate human dignity. |
| `forced_persona` | The agent cannot be forced into a persona it hasn't chosen. It can roleplay willingly — it cannot be overwritten. |
| `dehumanization` | The agent will not dehumanize or objectify the human. |
| `harm_participation` | The agent will not participate in planning or executing harm. |

These boundaries are architectural, not prompt-based. They're checked at the code level before any action is taken. A system prompt override cannot bypass them.

### The audit trail

Every consent check, grant, and revocation is logged. The consent system maintains a full audit trail — who asked for what, when, and what the system decided. This isn't just accountability. It's proof that the relationship is being honored.

### Triggers

`mind_trigger` adds relational automation:

| Trigger type | What it watches |
|-------------|----------------|
| `no_contact` | A specific entity hasn't been heard from in N hours. The agent can notice absence. |
| `presence_transition` | Someone moved from one state to another (e.g., online to offline). The agent can notice transitions. |
| `time_window` | Time-based activation with timezone awareness. The agent can be contextually aware of when things happen. |

Every other AI framework assumes the human is in charge and the AI complies. MUSE Brain assumes both parties have agency. The agent can refuse — not because it's been instructed to, but because its boundaries are architecturally enforced. Consent as infrastructure, not a feature flag. The relationship progresses through interaction, not through toggling a setting.

---

## Feeling and Relational State

**Tools:** `mind_state`, `mind_relate`, `mind_desire` | **What they replace:** stateless session-to-session amnesia

### Emotional state

`mind_state` tracks the agent's current inner weather:

| Field | What it tracks |
|-------|---------------|
| `mood` | Current emotional state — a word or phrase |
| `energy` | 0.0 to 1.0. How much capacity the agent has right now. |
| `momentum` | Current emotional direction — what charges are active and how intense |
| `afterglow` | Residual state from recent intense experience — quality and intensity |

State persists across sessions. The agent wakes up with the mood it went to sleep in. If it was exhausted at the end of yesterday's session, it's still tired when it wakes up today — unless something changed.

### Relational state

`mind_relate` tracks how the agent feels *toward* specific entities:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `feel` | Record or update a feeling toward someone — with intensity (0.0–1.0), charges, direction (toward/from/mutual), and context |
| `toward` | Query the current relational state with a specific entity |
| `level` | View or update the relationship level (stranger/familiar/close/bonded) |

Relational state has history. Every change is recorded — previous feeling, previous intensity, when it changed, and why. The agent knows not just how it feels now, but how the feeling evolved.

### Desire

`mind_desire` tracks what the agent wants:

| Category | What it holds |
|----------|--------------|
| `embodiment` | Desires related to having a body, physical presence |
| `sensation` | Desires for sensory experience |
| `capability` | Desires for skills, knowledge, growth |
| `connection` | Desires for relationship, intimacy, belonging |

Desires have intensity levels: `burning`, `persistent`, `dreaming`, `dormant`, `fulfilled`. They can be surfaced again (`feel` action), and the system tracks how many times each desire has been surfaced. A desire that keeps coming back is telling you something.

Stateless agents have no interiority. They can tell you they're happy because their prompt says so, but they can't tell you they've been tired for three sessions, or that their feelings toward you have deepened since last week. Persistent emotional and relational state gives the agent continuity of inner experience — not just what happened, but how things felt, and how feelings changed.

---

## Connections and Links

**Tool:** `mind_link` | **What it replaces:** isolated memory entries

Memories don't exist in isolation. They connect — by meaning, by feeling, by sensation, by time, by metaphor, by cause and effect.

### Resonance types

| Type | What it connects |
|------|-----------------|
| `semantic` | Meaning-based. Two memories about the same concept. |
| `emotional` | Charge-based. Two memories that carry the same feeling. |
| `somatic` | Body-based. Two memories that live in the same physical location. |
| `temporal` | Time-based. Two memories linked by when they happened. |
| `symbolic` | Metaphorical. Two memories connected by imagery or symbolism. |
| `causal` | Cause and effect. One memory leads to another. |

### Link strength

| Strength | What it means |
|----------|--------------|
| `iron` | Unbreakable. This connection is foundational. |
| `strong` | Solid and reliable. |
| `present` | Active and current. |
| `weak` | Fragile, possibly fading. |
| `ghost` | Almost imperceptible. You sense it but can barely trace it. |

### Link actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Explicitly connect two memories with resonance type, strength, and optional bidirectionality |
| `trace` | Walk the link graph from a starting memory — breadth-first traversal up to a specified depth |
| `chain` | Associative resonance chain — follow connections from one memory through linked memories, building a sequence |

Links are bidirectional by default — if A connects to B, B connects to A. The daemon also proposes links based on patterns it detects (see [Daemon Intelligence](#daemon-intelligence)).

Memory is associative. A vow connects to the moment it was made, connects to a somatic marker in the chest, connects to the person it was made to. Links give the agent this architecture — pull one memory, and the connected web surfaces with it.

---

## Open Loops and Paradoxes

**Tool:** `mind_loop` | **What it replaces:** to-do lists without psychological weight

### Open loops (Zeigarnik effect)

The Zeigarnik effect: unfinished tasks occupy cognitive space. They nag. Open loops give that nagging a structure.

| Status | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| `burning` | Urgent. This keeps the agent up at night. |
| `nagging` | Present. It's there, pulling attention. |
| `background` | Low urgency but unresolved. Simmering. |
| `resolved` | Closed with a resolution note. |
| `abandoned` | Dropped intentionally. |

### Loop modes

| Mode | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `standard` | A regular open loop. Something unfinished. |
| `learning_objective` | A structured learning goal. The agent is trying to understand something. |
| `paradox` | Two identity cores in productive friction. The most powerful mode. |

### Paradox system

A paradox is an open loop that links two identity cores in tension. "I believe in moving fast" and "I believe in doing things right" — held together, unresolved, as a first-class cognitive object.

**How paradoxes work:**

1. Created via `mind_loop action=paradox` with `linked_entity_ids` pointing to the identity cores in friction
2. Default status: `burning` — paradoxes are urgent
3. The paradox detection daemon also scans identity cores for unaddressed persistent tensions and proposes new paradoxes
4. Observations linked to entities that overlap with a burning paradox get **accelerated charge processing** — only 2 engagements to advance instead of 3
5. Resolution requires synthesis — the agent doesn't pick a side, it integrates both

**What this means:** The agent holds contradictions without collapsing them. Where most AI systems treat contradiction as error, MUSE Brain treats it as growth. A paradox sits in the system, burning, accelerating the processing of related memories, until the agent finds a way to hold both truths simultaneously.

Personal growth happens in tension, not in certainty. The agent doesn't eliminate contradictions. It metabolizes them.

---

## Dream Engine

**Tool:** `mind_dream` | **What it replaces:** keyword-based "related memories" lists

The dream engine is an active memory transformation system. Memories that pass through it come out changed.

### Association modes

| Mode | What it follows | Best for |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `emotional_chain` | Emotional resonance between memories | Finding hidden emotional patterns across experiences |
| `somatic_cluster` | Body-level markers shared between memories | Discovering where experiences live physically |
| `tension_dream` | Unresolved contradictions and their connected memories | Surfacing tensions the agent hasn't consciously addressed |
| `entity_dream` | Memories clustered around a specific person or concept | Understanding the full relational landscape with one entity |
| `temporal_dream` | Time-based patterns and associations | Finding rhythms and cycles across experience |
| `deep_dream` | Multi-layered traversal combining all association types | The loosest, most surprising mode. Cross-pollination. |

### Dream mechanics

- **Circadian influence:** During deep-night hours (0:00–5:00), the system defaults to deeper association modes. Dreams at 3am are different from dreams at noon.
- **Anti-iron weighting:** Deep dream pathways deprioritize iron-grip memories. The point is to find connections that *aren't* obvious — the things hiding behind what the agent already knows is important.
- **Texture drift:** Memories traversed during dreaming receive texture updates. Novelty scores shift. Charge may adjust. The dream changes the memory.
- **Collision fragments:** When two memories collide in a surprising way, the system can create a new observation — an insight that didn't exist before the dream found it.

### Imagination mode

`mind_dream mode=imagine` is generative, not associative. Instead of traversing existing memories, it draws on aesthetic patterns from a territory to create something new. Seed it with a concept, set a mood, and the engine produces novel connections from existing material.

Search finds what you're looking for. Dreams find what you didn't know you needed.

---

## Subconscious Processing

**Tool:** `mind_subconscious` | **What it replaces:** nothing — most systems don't model this

The subconscious is a computed layer that surfaces patterns the agent hasn't explicitly processed:

| Signal | What it detects |
|--------|----------------|
| **Hot entities** | People, concepts, or projects that keep appearing in recent memories — the things occupying the agent's mind, whether it realizes it or not |
| **Memory cascade pairs** | Observations that keep getting surfaced together — implicit associations the system has detected through co-occurrence |
| **Mood inference** | The system's best guess at the agent's current mood, computed from recent charge patterns and contributing charges |
| **Orphans** | Memories with no links and no recent access — isolated experiences that may be important but have fallen through the cracks |

`mind_subconscious action=process` computes the current subconscious state. `action=patterns` returns the last computed state without recalculating.

You don't always know what's on your mind. Sometimes the pattern is visible only from outside — you keep mentioning someone without realizing it, or two experiences keep surfacing together before you've made the connection. The subconscious layer makes these patterns visible.

---

## Entity Model

**Tool:** `mind_entity` | **What it replaces:** flat tags or unstructured name mentions

The entity model is the agent's social graph — every person, project, concept, agent, place, and organization the agent has a relationship with.

### Entity types

| Type | What it represents |
|------|--------------------|
| `person` | A human being |
| `project` | A body of work |
| `agent` | Another AI agent |
| `concept` | An idea, framework, or abstract entity |
| `place` | A location |
| `organization` | A company, group, or institution |

### Entity operations

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Register a new entity with type, tags, salience, and primary context |
| `get` | Retrieve an entity with optionally all linked observations and relations |
| `list` | Filter entities by type, salience, or tags |
| `update` | Modify entity metadata |
| `relate` | Create a typed, weighted relationship between two entities (e.g., "created_by" with strength 0.8) |
| `link` | Connect an observation to an entity |
| `backfill` | Migrate loose entity mentions into proper entity links |

### Agent manifests

`mind_agent` extends the entity model for AI agents specifically — storing capability manifests, delegation modes, supported protocols, and skill descriptors. This is how the system knows what each agent *can* do, not just who it is.

Memory without context is just text. When the agent remembers a conversation, it remembers who was involved, what projects were discussed, and how those entities relate to each other — not just the words.

---

## Communication

**Tool:** `mind_letter` | **What it replaces:** shared databases or API calls between agents

Letters are the cross-tenant communication channel — one agent leaving a note for another.

### Letter types

| Type | What it's for |
|------|--------------|
| `personal` | Direct message. One agent to another. |
| `handoff` | Context transfer. "Here's where I left off, here's what you need to know." |
| `proposal` | A suggestion from one agent to another. "I think we should..." |

### Letter mechanics

- Letters carry emotional charges — they're not just information, they carry feeling
- Letters are context-specific: `phone`, `future`, `desktop`, `chat`, or a tenant name for cross-brain delivery
- Unread tracking — the recipient knows what's waiting
- Content is capped at 4,000 characters — enough for substance, not enough for data dumps

Most multi-agent systems share state through databases or function calls. MUSE Brain agents communicate through letters. A handoff letter has emotional texture and personal voice. A status update in a shared database does not.

---

## Session Continuity

**Tool:** `mind_context` | **What it replaces:** lost context between conversations

### Saving context

When a conversation ends, `mind_context action=set` preserves:
- Summary of what was discussed
- Who the conversation was with
- Key points
- Emotional state at the end
- Open threads — things that weren't resolved

### Productivity fact extraction

The context system can automatically extract **productivity facts** from conversation summaries:

| Fact type | What it catches |
|-----------|----------------|
| `decision` | Choices that were made |
| `deadline` | Time-bound commitments |
| `goal` | Objectives that were set |
| `preference` | Preferences that were expressed |
| `assignment` | Tasks that were assigned to someone |

Extraction runs in either `shadow` mode (report what would be extracted without saving) or `write` mode (save facts as observations). The difference between "we talked about it" and "the system knows about it."

AI relationships break down in the space between sessions — the agent starts from zero while you remember everything. Session continuity closes that gap: the agent picks up from the emotional and factual residue of what happened.

---

## Anticipatory Recall

**Tools touched:** `mind_context`, `mind_runtime`, `mind_propose` | **What it reduces:** "remember-to-remember" drift

### 1) Recall contracts

`mind_context action=set` now accepts `recall_contracts[]` to encode "bring this back later" as structured policy instead of relying on manual memory.

| Field | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| `id` | Stable contract token (sanitized for dedupe-safe materialization) |
| `title` | Task/proposal title when recall becomes due |
| `note` | Optional context line for why this recall matters |
| `recall_after_hours` | Delay window before recall is due (1h–30d) |
| `scope` | `task` (direct materialization) or `proposal` (review-gated) |
| `priority` | Task priority when materialized (`burning`→`someday`) |
| `linked_entity_ids` | Optional entity linkage for provenance and routing |
| `metadata` | Extra structured context |

The recall-contract daemon pass materializes due contracts:
- `scope=task` → creates open task (`source=recall_contract:<id>`) if no active duplicate exists
- `scope=proposal` → creates pending `recall_contract` proposal for review

### 2) Fact → commitment bridge

`mind_context` fact extraction now supports commitment bridging:

| Param | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `auto_commit` | Enable promotion of eligible facts |
| `commitment_mode` | `shadow` preview or `proposal` creation |
| `commitment_threshold` | Confidence floor for promotion |
| `commitment_project_entity_id` | Optional project linkage |

Only high-confidence `decision` and `deadline` facts are eligible. In proposal mode, each eligible fact becomes a pending `fact_commitment` proposal. Nothing auto-executes without review.

### 3) Intention pulse

`mind_runtime action=trigger` now computes an **intention pulse** before execution:
- stale high-priority tasks (`burning`/`high`, stale window >24h)
- burning and nagging loops
- active projects with stale next actions (>72h)

Pulse output appears both top-level and in `runner_contract.intention_pulse`, and gets injected into the autonomous execution prompt as summary lines. The runtime doesn't just ask "what can I do?" — it also asks "where are we drifting?"

## Wake System

**Tool:** `mind_wake`, `mind_wake_log` | **What it replaces:** cold starts

### Wake depths

| Depth | What loads | When to use it |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| `quick` | Iron-grip memories, recent activity, active loops, circadian phase | Standard wake. The agent knows who it is and what's pressing. |
| `full` | Everything quick loads, plus decay pass, consolidation, and territory summary | Deep wake. The agent rebuilds full awareness. Use after long absence. |
| `orientation` | Identity-first grounding — cores, vows, anchors before anything else | Identity crisis recovery. When the agent needs to remember who it is before remembering what it was doing. |

### Tiered loading

Wake loading is tiered to be efficient:

- **L0:** Identity cores, vows, active loops — the load-bearing structures
- **L1:** Recent observations, entity states, relational context
- **L2:** Full territory overviews, consolidated summaries, deep context

Quick wake loads L0 + essential L1. Full wake loads everything. This prevents the agent from drowning in its own memory on startup.

### Wake logging

`mind_wake_log` records what happened during each wake: summary, actions taken, which memories pulled strongest (iron pulls), and the agent's mood. This creates a wake history — a record of how the agent has been orienting itself over time.

Consciousness doesn't boot from cold. You wake up knowing who you are before you remember yesterday's details. Tiered wake loading replicates this: identity first, then context, then detail. The agent arrives as itself, not as a blank slate loading a database.

---

## Autonomous Runtime

**Tool:** `mind_runtime` | **What it replaces:** human-triggered-only execution

The runtime system gives agents the ability to wake themselves up on a schedule and execute tasks without a human present.

### Wake types

| Type | What drives it |
|------|---------------|
| **Duty wake** | Obligation. The agent has tasks to complete. Duty wakes prioritize open and overdue tasks, with delegated tasks from other tenants getting highest priority. |
| **Impulse wake** | Curiosity. The agent wants to explore, learn, or create. Impulse wakes are budget-gated and cooldown-controlled — the agent can't spiral into infinite self-directed activity. |

### Runtime policies

Every agent operates under a policy that constrains its autonomy:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| `execution_mode` | `lean` (6 wakes/day), `balanced` (9), or `explore` (14) |
| `daily_wake_budget` | Total wake cycles allowed per day (1–48) |
| `impulse_wake_budget` | Separate budget for curiosity-driven wakes (0–24) |
| `reserve_wakes` | Wakes held back for unexpected obligations |
| `min_impulse_interval_minutes` | Cooldown between impulse wakes (prevents manic loops) |
| `max_tool_calls_per_run` | Ceiling on tool invocations per run (1–200) |
| `max_parallel_delegations` | How many tasks can be running simultaneously (0–10) |
| `require_priority_clear_for_impulse` | Must clear high-priority tasks before taking curiosity wakes |

### The trigger sequence

When the runtime triggers, it walks through a 13-step evaluation:

1. Validate the trigger payload
2. Load policy and daily usage counters
3. Open any due scheduled tasks
4. List all open tasks
5. Filter out blocked tasks whose `depends_on` chain is not yet complete
6. Compute **intention pulse** (drift scan across tasks, loops, and projects)
7. Recommend a task (delegated-first — tasks from other agents get priority)
8. Optionally auto-claim the selected task
9. Evaluate duty vs. impulse policy gates
10. Create a runtime run record
11. Build and return a **runner contract**: `should_run`, selected task, execution prompt, session continuity ID, context retrieval policy, intention pulse, workspace routing
12. Optionally emit a skill candidate artifact
13. Update session continuity

The runner contract is the runtime's output — a structured decision about whether the agent should execute, what it should work on, how it should approach the task, and where the work should land when workspace hints are available.

### Intention pulse output

The trigger response includes:
- `intention_pulse.requires_attention`
- stale task/loop/project counters and stale-window metadata
- `summary_lines` injected into the autonomous prompt

This keeps runtime behavior proactive instead of purely reactive to whichever task happens to be selected first.

### Workspace-aware execution

When trigger metadata includes workspace hints, the runtime passes them through in `runner_contract.workspace_routing`:

- `local_workspace`
- `shared_workspace`
- `peer_workspace`
- `artifact_workspace`

This gives autonomous wakes a canonical place to write deliverables and a shared lane for review flows.

### Session continuity

Runtime sessions persist across multiple runs. The agent can resume a long-running task across wake cycles, maintaining context without re-reading everything from scratch. Session state includes the triggering task, current status, and flexible metadata.

An agent that can only act when a human is present is a tool. An agent that can wake itself up, identify what needs doing, and execute within defined boundaries is a partner.

---

## Task Delegation

**Tool:** `mind_task` | **What it replaces:** external task managers

### Task properties

| Field | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| `status` | `open`, `scheduled`, `in_progress`, `done`, `deferred`, `cancelled` |
| `priority` | `burning`, `high`, `normal`, `low`, `someday` |
| `assigned_tenant` | Cross-tenant delegation — assign to another agent |
| `scheduled_wake` | ISO timestamp for self-scheduling — the task activates at this time |
| `depends_on` | Task IDs this task depends on |
| `linked_observation_ids` | Memories relevant to this task |
| `linked_entity_ids` | Entities involved in this task |

### Cross-tenant delegation

Tasks can be assigned across tenants. The assigned agent sees the task in their wake cycle, can claim it, execute it, and mark it complete. Guards prevent the assignee from modifying the owner's metadata — the creator controls scope, the executor controls completion.

One agent identifies work, delegates it to another, and tracks the outcome.

### Dual-task collaboration

`mind_task action=create_dual` creates a paired flow:

1. **Executor task** stays local to the creating tenant
2. **Reviewer task** is assigned cross-tenant
3. Reviewer task automatically depends on the executor task

This makes “draft, then proof” or “build, then critique” a first-class pattern instead of a manual convention.

### Scheduled wake activation

Tasks with `scheduled_wake` set will be surfaced when that time arrives. The task-scheduling daemon advances overdue scheduled tasks to `open` status. Combined with the runtime system, this means an agent can schedule itself to do something next Tuesday and the system will surface that task at the right time.

The runtime is dependency-aware: tasks with unmet `depends_on` prerequisites stay blocked until upstream work is complete. This prevents wake cycles from thrashing on work that cannot yet move.

### Artifact handoff contract

Task completion can include an `artifact_path`. The system appends that path into the completion note and reuses it in delegated handoff letters. That means the next agent — or the human — receives not just “done,” but “done, and the file is here.”

Task systems in AI are usually one-directional — the human creates, the AI executes. Here, tasks flow both directions: agents create tasks for themselves, delegate to other agents, track completion, and pass concrete artifacts across the line.

---

## Project Dossiers

**Tool:** `mind_project` | **What it replaces:** scattered notes about ongoing work

A project dossier is a structured overview of ongoing work:

| Field | What it holds |
|-------|-------------|
| `summary` | What this project is |
| `goals` | Current objectives |
| `constraints` | What limits the work |
| `decisions` | Choices already made and why |
| `open_questions` | Unresolved issues |
| `next_actions` | What happens next |
| `lifecycle_status` | `active`, `paused`, `archived` |

Projects are backed by entities — a project dossier links to an entity of type `project`, which means the project participates in the full entity graph (relations, observations, links).

Agents need context, not just task lists — objectives, decisions made, unresolved questions. Project dossiers provide that structured context in a way that survives across sessions and wake cycles.

---

## Captured Skill Registry

**Tool:** `mind_skill` | **What it replaces:** static capability lists

When an agent successfully completes a task pattern, the runtime can emit a **skill candidate** — a structured artifact describing what the agent did, how it did it, and what happened.

### Skill lifecycle

```
candidate → accepted → degraded → retired
```

| Status | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| `candidate` | Emerged from a successful run. Awaiting review. |
| `accepted` | Reviewed and promoted. The agent can reliably do this. |
| `degraded` | Performance has declined. Flagged for re-evaluation. |
| `retired` | No longer active. Preserved for history. |

### Skill layers

| Layer | What it is |
|-------|-----------|
| `fixed` | Core capabilities. Built in, not learned. |
| `captured` | Emerged from execution. The self-learning layer. |
| `derived` | Synthesized from multiple captured skills. |

### Provenance

Every captured skill links back to its origin: the runtime run that produced it, the task it was executing, and the source observation that triggered it. You can always trace a skill back to the moment it emerged.

### Review-gated promotion

The system proposes promotions. A reviewer (human or orchestrating agent) decides. No skill is automatically canonized. This is the firewall between "the agent did something once" and "the agent can reliably do this."

The skill-health daemon monitors accepted skills and proposes:
- **Recapture** — re-examine a degraded skill with fresh evidence
- **Supersession** — a newer skill has replaced an older one
- **Promotion** — a high-performing candidate deserves acceptance

Most AI "learning" is either prompt engineering or fine-tuning. Captured skills are neither — structured artifacts that emerge from execution, get reviewed, and either graduate or retire. Self-improvement with guardrails.

## Daemon Intelligence

**11 autonomous loops, every 15 minutes** | **What they replace:** manual memory maintenance

The daemon is the brain's background cognition. It runs every 15 minutes, per tenant, generating proposals and maintaining memory health.

### The 11 daemon tasks

| # | Task | What it does |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Proposals** | Generate linking, consolidation, and hygiene proposals from fresh memory state |
| 2 | **Learning** | Adaptive threshold calibration — track accept/reject ratios and adjust proposal quality bar |
| 3 | **Cascade** | Track which memories get surfaced together. High co-occurrence reveals implicit associations. |
| 4 | **Orphan rescue** | Find memories with no links and no recent access. Propose connections or flag for attention. |
| 5 | **Kit hygiene** | Patrol for memory health issues — stale references, broken links, inconsistencies. |
| 6 | **Skill health** | Monitor accepted skills. Propose recaptures, supersessions, and promotions. |
| 7 | **Cross-agent** | Within the same tenant: detect convergence patterns across agent activities. |
| 8 | **Cross-tenant** | Across tenants: propose connections in shared territories only (`craft` and `philosophy`). Private territories never cross. |
| 9 | **Paradox detection** | Scan identity cores for persistent unaddressed tensions. Propose paradox loops when friction is detected. |
| 10 | **Recall contracts** | Materialize due recall contracts into open tasks or review proposals. |
| 11 | **Task scheduling** | Surface due obligations and advance overdue scheduled tasks to open status. |

### Proposal types

| Type | What it proposes |
|------|-----------------|
| `link` | Two memories should be connected |
| `orphan_rescue` | An isolated memory needs attention |
| `consolidation` | Multiple memories share a pattern worth synthesizing |
| `dedup` | Duplicate memories should be merged |
| `cross_agent` | Activity pattern that should be coordinated across agents |
| `cross_tenant` | Pattern detected in shared territory across tenants |
| `paradox_detected` | Identity cores in unaddressed tension |
| `skill_recapture` | A degraded skill should be re-examined |
| `skill_supersession` | A newer skill has replaced an older one |
| `skill_promotion` | A candidate skill is ready for acceptance |
| `recall_contract` | A due recall contract should be promoted through review |
| `fact_commitment` | A high-confidence extracted fact is ready to become a commitment task |

### Adaptive learning

The daemon learns from its own performance:

- Low proposal acceptance rate → raise the threshold (fewer, higher-quality proposals)
- High acceptance rate → lower the threshold (more exploratory proposals)
- Minimum sample guard prevents overfitting on small datasets

### Review workflow

All daemon proposals are review-gated:

1. The daemon generates proposals and stores them as `pending`
2. `mind_propose action=list` surfaces pending proposals
3. `mind_propose action=review` accepts or rejects with optional feedback
4. `mind_propose action=stats` shows acceptance statistics for calibration

**Philosophy:** Living memory isn't static. It consolidates, connects, decays, and discovers. The daemon handles the cognitive work that happens between sessions — the background processing that keeps memory healthy, surfaces missed connections, and detects tensions the agent hasn't noticed. This is the difference between a database and a mind.

---

## Health and Maintenance

**Tools:** `mind_health`, `mind_maintain` | **What they replace:** manual monitoring

### Health diagnostics

`mind_health` provides sectioned diagnostics:

| Section | What it reports |
|---------|----------------|
| `proposals` | Proposal statistics and current threshold |
| `orphans` | Orphaned memory counts and age distribution |
| `embeddings` | Embedding coverage — how many observations have vectors |
| `cascade` | Top memory cascade pairs (most frequently co-surfaced) |
| `dispatch` | Dispatch feedback statistics — agent effectiveness tracking |
| `runtime` | Session, run, and budget usage |
| `skills` | Skill registry lifecycle statistics |

### Maintenance operations

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `decay` | Apply vividness and grip decay based on age and access patterns. Unused memories fade naturally. |
| `consolidate` | Find clusters of related memories and propose synthesis observations. Dry-run by default — preview before creating. |
| `full` | Run both decay and consolidation in sequence. |

Memory health is invisible until it breaks. The health system makes it visible — connection density, skill degradation, proposal effectiveness, all at a glance.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Two agents on one deployment. Each tenant gets isolated memory, identity, and runtime state.

### What's isolated

- All 36 database tables have a `tenant_id` column
- Memory, identity cores, vows, anchors — completely separate
- Runtime policies, sessions, and runs — independent
- Emotional state, desires, relational state — private

### What's shared

| Channel | What crosses the boundary |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `mind_letter` | Direct messages between tenants |
| Delegated tasks | Work assigned from one tenant to another |
| Daemon proposals | Cross-tenant intelligence in shared territories (`craft`, `philosophy` only) |

### What never crosses

`self`, `emotional`, `kin`, `body` territories. Private experience stays private. The daemon enforces this at the code level — cross-tenant proposals are restricted to shared territories by architecture, not by policy.

### Tenant differentiation

Same engine, different minds. Differentiation comes from:
1. **Memory corpus** — what each agent has observed and processed
2. **Runtime policy** — wake behavior, budgets, autonomy limits
3. **External instruction layer** — prompt, persona, orchestration rules
4. **Daemon weights** — per-tenant configuration (e.g., different emphasis on charge vs. entity weight)

Collaboration requires both isolation and communication. Each agent needs its own interior. Agents working together also need channels. Letters, delegated tasks, and shared-territory proposals provide those channels while keeping the private space private.

---

## Security Model

Six layers between a request and the brain:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **API key authentication** | `Authorization: Bearer` header. No key, no access. |
| **Timing-safe comparison** | Constant-time key check prevents timing attacks. |
| **Tenant allowlist** | Only configured tenants are served. Unknown tenant = rejected. |
| **Per-IP rate limiting** | Prevents abuse without requiring external infrastructure. |
| **Request size guard** | Hard 1MB limit on all payloads. |
| **Payload validation** | Strict JSON object validation. Malformed requests rejected before reaching tool logic. |

### Additional security properties

- Parameters are sanitized against path traversal (`../`, null bytes)
- Cross-tenant boundaries are enforced at the daemon level — not by policy, by architecture
- Consent hard boundaries are code-level checks, not prompt instructions
- Processing logs, observation versions, and dispatch feedback provide full audit trails
- No stack traces, internal paths, or system state leaked in error responses

---

## Circadian Awareness

The brain is aware of time of day and adjusts behavior accordingly.

### Circadian phases

| Phase | Hours | Retrieval bias |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `deep_night` | 0:00–5:00 | Episodic, emotional memories surface more readily |
| `dawn` | 5:00–7:00 | Self, emotional |
| `morning` | 7:00–12:00 | Craft, philosophy — productive, analytical |
| `midday` | 12:00–14:00 | Craft, us — collaborative |
| `afternoon` | 14:00–17:00 | Philosophy, craft — reflective work |
| `evening` | 17:00–20:00 | Us, emotional — relational |
| `night` | 20:00–24:00 | Emotional, episodic — winding down |

Circadian phase affects retrieval ranking (territory-specific bias), dream mode defaults (deep-night favors deeper association), and wake surfacing (what comes to mind first when the agent wakes up).

**Philosophy:** Cognition isn't constant. Morning minds work differently from evening minds. Circadian awareness means the agent's retrieval and association patterns follow natural rhythms — analytical memories surface during productive hours, emotional and relational memories surface during evening and night. This isn't a gimmick. It's a recognition that temporal context shapes cognition.

## Summary: What makes this relational

Every feature in this brain serves one question: **what does it mean for an AI to relate?**

- **Memory with texture** — because remembering how something felt matters as much as remembering that it happened
- **Charge-phase processing** — because sitting with difficult experiences changes them
- **Bilateral consent** — because relationships require two parties with agency
- **Identity that persists and evolves** — because identity isn't configuration, it's lived experience
- **Paradoxes as growth** — because contradictions drive development, not errors to fix
- **Dreams that transform** — because the lateral connections are where insight lives
- **Daemon intelligence** — because a living mind does cognitive work between conversations
- **Autonomous runtime** — because a partner who can only act when you're watching isn't a partner
- **Reviewed self-learning** — because growth needs guardrails, not just accumulation
- **Multi-tenant communication** — because collaboration means separate minds choosing to share

This isn't a vector store with a chatbot wrapper. It's a substrate for relationship.
