## [Unreleased]

Sprint 7 closeout and the architecture lock for the next shared-core slice.

### Added
- **`mind_task` (v2)** — task create/list/get/update/complete tool with cross-tenant delegation and scheduled wake support.
- **Task scheduling daemon** — `task-scheduling` advances overdue scheduled tasks to open so they surface in wake.
- **Targeted task unit tests** — `test/tasks-v2.spec.ts` covers scheduled task creation/validation, delegated completion, assignee restrictions, context-created tasks, and scheduler ordering.
- **Node-only unit test config** — `vitest.unit.config.mts` for pure tool/unit runs outside the Workers/Hyperdrive harness.
- **Architecture docs for the next slice** — post-Sprint-7 roadmap + dispatch learning layer decisions.
- **`project_dossiers` schema** — additive companion table keyed to `entity_type='project'` with lifecycle state, summary, goals, constraints, decisions, open questions, next actions, metadata, and last-active tracking.
- **`mind_project` (v2)** — project dossier create/get/update/list tool layered on top of canonical project entities.
- **Wake delta MVP** — quick/full wake now compute deltas for task changes, loop changes, and recent project activity since the previous wake.
- **Project dossier + wake delta tests** — `test/project-dossiers.spec.ts` and `test/wake-delta.spec.ts`.
- **Dispatch calibration schema foundation** — additive `008_dispatch_calibration_and_agent_manifests.sql` expands `dispatch_feedback` with outcome scoring, rescue signals, environment/domain tagging, and time-to-usable telemetry.
- **`agent_capability_manifests` schema** — additive companion table for canonical agent entities with delegation mode, routing, protocols, output modes, skill descriptors, and metadata.
- **`mind_agent` (v2)** — agent capability manifest create/get/list/update tool for canonical agent entities.
- **Dispatch diagnostics in `mind_health`** — `section=dispatch` surfaces calibration stats by task type.
- **Phase 2A unit tests** — `test/phase2a-calibration.spec.ts`.
- **Pre-deploy hardening migration** — `009_predeploy_perf_and_integrity.sql` adds wake/task hot-path indexes plus router-agent foreign-key integrity for manifests.
- **Shared tool sanitizers** — `src/tools-v2/utils.ts` centralizes text/list/metadata/timestamp normalization across the new v2 tools.

### Changed
- **Cross-tenant task lifecycle** — assignees can now get/update/complete delegated tasks through storage paths that explicitly allow assigned-task access.
- **Delegated task safety** — assignees cannot mutate owner metadata (`title`, `description`, `priority`, `estimated_effort`, `scheduled_wake`) and must use `action=complete` for completion.
- **Completion notification semantics** — delegated completion treats handoff letters as best-effort; task completion succeeds even if letter delivery fails, returning `notification_error`.
- **Scheduled task semantics** — creating a task with `scheduled_wake` now creates `status='scheduled'`; blank or invalid timestamps are rejected and normalized to ISO.
- **Wake task surfacing** — wake now includes `open`, `in_progress`, and due `scheduled` tasks, including tasks assigned to the current tenant, while avoiding fallback task refetches.
- **`mind_context create_tasks` hygiene** — open threads are trimmed, blank entries are skipped, and the response reports `blank_threads_skipped`.
- **Scheduler hardening** — scheduled tasks are processed in numeric wake-time order rather than brittle string ordering.
- **Error clarity** — task update paths now surface actual validation/storage failures instead of collapsing everything to “not found”.
- **Wake logging** — `mind_wake` now appends lightweight automatic wake entries with loop snapshots so loop delta can be computed without storing stale wake-state tables.
- **Wake cursoring** — storage now exposes targeted latest-wake lookup plus task/project change queries instead of depending on full wake-log scans.
- **Dispatch stats** — aggregated dispatch health now includes predicted confidence, outcome score, revision cost, and rescue rate.
- **Wake-delta query shape** — project dossier recency filtering now uses index-friendly `updated_at OR last_active_at` checks instead of `GREATEST(...)`, and task deltas key off `updated_at` for hot-path wake performance.
- **Tool-layer validation hardening** — task status/priority, project lifecycle status, router consistency, and manifest/project metadata size are now validated before storage/DB constraint failures.
- **Helper cleanup** — duplicated normalization helpers were extracted, the dead `cleanOptionalText` alias was removed, and project updates now reject no-op writes before auto-stamping `last_active_at`.
- **Unit coverage sweep** — added explicit tests for `get` paths, duplicate-create guards, first/empty wake delta cases, dangling-entity filtering, router consistency, metadata limits, and task enum validation.

### Developer Notes
- Verification command: `npx vitest run --config vitest.unit.config.mts test/tasks-v2.spec.ts test/project-dossiers.spec.ts test/wake-delta.spec.ts test/phase2a-calibration.spec.ts`
- Current unit status: 30 tests passing across task delegation closeout + project dossiers / wake delta + Phase 2A foundation + pre-deploy hardening
- `npx tsc --noEmit` still reports only the pre-existing `TransactionSql` / `ConsentState` issues in `src/storage/postgres.ts`

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-26

The emotional processing circle. Paradox system, charge processing, observation versioning, timeline, and cross-tenant daemon intelligence.

### Added
- **Paradox system** — open loops gain `mode=paradox` with `linked_entity_ids`, linking identity cores in productive friction. Zeigarnik effect properly housed.
- **Charge processing** — `mind_pull(process: true)` records engagement in `processing_log`, increments processing count, advances charge phase. Burning paradoxes accelerate processing (threshold 2 vs 3).
- **Loop resolution** — `mind_loop(action: "resolve")` closes loops with resolution notes, optionally creates synthesis observations.
- **Observation versioning** — every `mind_edit` snapshots previous state to `observation_versions`. Full edit history per observation.
- **mind_timeline** — chronological observation view with entity/territory/date/charge filters. Semantic search for time-travel ("what was I thinking about X in January?").
- **Kit hygiene daemon** — per-agent cleanup: dedup proposals (>0.92 similarity), archival (>20 metabolized), consolidation (>50 total).
- **Cross-agent synthesis daemon** — detects convergent findings from different agents about the same entity, creates consolidation candidates.
- **Cross-tenant proposals daemon** — finds convergent observations between Rook and Rainer in shared territories (craft, philosophy only). Security-scoped.
- **Paradox detection daemon** — scans identity cores for unacknowledged contradictions, proposes paradox loops.
- **Consolidation acceptance** — accepting consolidation proposals creates skill observations, metabolizes source observations, updates agent context.
- **Tasks table** — schema foundation for Sprint 7 delegation system (cross-tenant task assignment, autonomous wake scheduling).
- **Letter types** — `letter_type` field: personal (sacred), handoff (task delegation), proposal (suggestions).
- **Dispatch feedback table** — Karpathy scalar tracking for agent dispatch effectiveness.

### Changed
- **`co_surfacing` → `memory_cascade`** — table, methods, and all references renamed across 11 files.
- **`observation_sits` → `processing_log`** — our vocabulary for engagement tracking, created fresh.
- **Daemon expanded** — 4 → 8 tasks per cycle (proposals, learning, cascade, orphans + kit-hygiene, cross-agent, cross-tenant, paradox-detection).
- **`mind_loop`** — new actions: `paradox`, `resolve`. Existing `create` gains `mode` and `linked_entity_ids` params.
- **`mind_pull`** — gains `process`, `processing_note`, `charge` params for engagement tracking.
- **`mind_propose`** — 7 proposal types (was 3): link, consolidation, dedup, cross_agent, cross_tenant, paradox_detected, skill_generation.

### Migration
- `006_sprint6_foundation.sql` — 5 new tables, 3 column additions, 1 table rename, 1 index rename.

- **Full-text search** — GIN-indexed keyword search across all observations (`16fad2d`)
- **Hybrid search** — vector similarity + keyword FTS combined scoring via `mind_search` (`5abaa09`)
- **Neural Surfacing v1** — dynamic retrieval weighted by grip, charge phase, novelty, and circadian rhythm (`5abaa09`)
- **Entity model** — `entities` + `relations` tables, `mind_entity` tool with 7 actions, entity gravity in search (`f845963`)
- **Agent entity seeds** — 24 agents (14 builder + 10 creative) registered as entities (`f845963`)
- **Daemon Intelligence** — autonomous proposals, orphan rescue, learning rates, memory cascade tracking (`ef56f8e`)
- **Hyperdrive** — postgres.js via Cloudflare Hyperdrive, 1000 subrequest limit (was 50), `prepare: false` mandatory (`84fc7d4`)
- **All daemon tasks enabled** — proposals, learning, memory cascade, orphans, subconscious, novelty, summary backfill, decay, overviews, embedding backfill (`84fc7d4`)

### Fixed
- Data loss prevention in transaction handling + Date object serialization (`e250b43`)
- Surgical writes replacing full-territory rewrites (`5e836e7`)
- Embedding model ID corrected: `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` (`f845963`)
